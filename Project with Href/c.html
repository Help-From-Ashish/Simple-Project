  <p align="justify">C is probably the most widely known programming language. It is used as the reference language for computer science courses all over the world, and it's probably the language that people learn the most in school along with Python and Java.</p>
  <p align="justify">I remember it being my second programming language ever, after Pascal.</p>
  <p align="justify">C is not just what students use to learn programming. It's not an academic language. And I would say it's not the easiest language, because C is a rather low level programming language.</p>
  <p align="justify">Today, C is widely used in embedded devices, and it powers most of the Internet servers, which are built using Linux. The Linux kernel is built using C, and this also means that C powers the core of all Android devices. We can say that C code runs a good portion of the entire world. Right now. Pretty remarkable.</p>
  <p align="justify">When it was created, C was considered a high level language, because it was portable across machines. Today we kind of take for granted that we can run a program written on a Mac on Windows or Linux, perhaps using Node.js or Python.</p>
  <p align="justify">Once upon a time, this was not the case at all. What C brought to the table was a language that was simple to implement and that had a compiler that could be easily ported to different machines.</p>
  <p align="justify">I said compiler: C is a compiled programming language, like Go, Java, Swift or Rust. Other popular programming language like Python, Ruby or JavaScript are interpreted. The difference is consistent: a compiled language generates a binary file that can be directly executed and distributed.</p>
  <p align="justify">C is not garbage collected. This means we have to manage memory ourselves. It's a complex task and one that requires a lot of attention to prevent bugs, but it is also what makes C ideal to write programs for embedded devices like Arduino.</p>
  <p align="justify">C does not hide the complexity and the capabilities of the machine underneath. You have a lot of power, once you know what you can do.    </p>
